Generates TS defintions from the Strava API Doc.

The strava API spec is written in Open API V2 (Swagger), but the openapi-typescript tool only supports v3.

As openapi-typescript had the nicest API for generating types, I converted the Strava V2 swagger doc to V3 using: [https://editor.swagger.io/](https://editor.swagger.io/)

The original API spec can be found at: [https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json](https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json)
